# Screenshots Directory

This directory contains screenshots of the Macro Data Refinement Simulator.

To add a screenshot:
1. Take a screenshot of the application
2. Name it appropriately (e.g., "preview.png", "selection-screen.png", etc.)
3. Place it in this directory
4. Update the main README.md file to reference the screenshot

The main README.md file currently references a screenshot named "preview.png" which should be placed in this directory.
