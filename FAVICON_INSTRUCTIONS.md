# Creating a Favicon for the Project

A favicon is a small icon that appears in the browser tab next to the page title. To create a favicon for the Macro Data Refinement Simulator:

## Option 1: Create a Simple Favicon

1. Use an online favicon generator like [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) or [realfavicongenerator.net](https://realfavicongenerator.net/)
2. Create a simple icon with the letters "MDR" or a simple grid pattern in the neon blue color (#00c3ff)
3. Download the generated favicon.ico file
4. Place it in the root directory of the project

## Option 2: Create a Custom Favicon

1. Use an image editing program like Photoshop, GIMP, or an online tool
2. Create a 32x32 pixel image with a design that represents the project
3. Use the neon blue color (#00c3ff) to match the application's theme
4. Save the image as favicon.ico
5. Place it in the root directory of the project

## Option 3: Use a Placeholder Favicon

1. Find a free placeholder favicon online
2. Download it as favicon.ico
3. Place it in the root directory of the project

## Testing the Favicon

After adding the favicon.ico file to the project:

1. Open the index.html file in a browser
2. Check if the favicon appears in the browser tab
3. If it doesn't appear, try clearing your browser cache and reloading the page

## Committing the Favicon

After creating and testing the favicon:

```bash
git add favicon.ico
git commit -m "Add favicon"
git push
```

This will add the favicon to your GitHub repository.
